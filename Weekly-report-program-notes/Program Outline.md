My goal is to develop a program that will automate weekly reporting to a supervisor boss or some other person that you work with and have to report your progress hours done and what you completed throughout the week to someone. In general it is needed to be custom so that it is flexible with how you are reporting to a different individual or different job. Although in this case it should be simplistic with A [[3 Template system]] where it can vary from simplistic recap summaries of your week to be sent to an individual and then an in-depth detailed report that goes into progress updates graph changes or even hours committed into a project. The idea of this program is that it is quite flexible to be able to work with multiple different types of calendars whether it's on your phone laptop or even a server. the evolution of the program is going to look like this:
- Develop the program to work in outlook
- Refine the program for ease of use and detail
- Move the program to google calendar
- Interchange the program so if one calendar is changed all colanders are updated. 
- Implement into android and it's calendar
